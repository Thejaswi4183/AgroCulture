AgroCulture: Bridging Farmers and Consumers

AgroCulture is a web-based application designed to revolutionize the agricultural marketplace by eliminating intermediaries, thereby facilitating direct transactions between farmers and consumers. This platform empowers farmers to list their produce, set prices, and reach a broader market, while consumers benefit from access to fresh products at competitive prices. The system aims to enhance transparency, reduce costs, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
